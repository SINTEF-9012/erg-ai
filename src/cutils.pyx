    """Split data sequence into samples with matching input and targets.

    Args:
        sequences (array): The matrix containing the sequences, with the
            targets in the first columns.
        window_size (int): Number of time steps to include in each sample, i.e.
            how much history should be matched with a given target.
        target_size (int): Size of target window. Default=1, i.e. only one
            value is used as target.
        n_target_columns: Number of target columns. Default=1.
        future_predict (bool): Whether to predict target values backwards or
            forward from the last time step in the input sequence.
            Default=False, which means that the number of target values will be
            counted backwards.
        overlap (int): How many time steps to overlap for each sequence. If
            overlap is greater than window_size, it will be set to
            window_size-1, which is the largest overlap possible.  Default=0,
            which means there will be no overlap.

    Returns:
        X (array): The input samples.
        y (array): The targets.
